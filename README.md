#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software programs. 

it's importance: Makes Software Reliable – It helps create software that works correctly and doesn’t crash easily. 

Saves Time and Resources – Following good practices makes software development faster and more organized. 

Helps Software Grow – Well-designed software can be updated and improved over time without starting from scratch. 

Encourages Innovation – Many modern technologies, like mobile apps, artificial intelligence, and websites, exist because of software engineering. 

Protects Data and Security – It ensures software is safe from hackers and cyber threats. 

Creates Job Opportunities – Many companies need software engineers, making it a great career choice. 

Improves User Experience – Good software is easy to use and solves real-world problems. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering- The term "software engineering" was first used at a NATO conference in 1968. It marked the beginning of structured programming and formalized development processes. 

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) became popular with languages like C++, Java, and Python. This helped create more scalable and flexible applications. 

The Agile Revolution -The Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001 to improve how teams build software. It led to popular frameworks like Scrum and DevOps, which are widely used today.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning -This is the first step where teams define the project goals, requirements, and estimated costs. 
Requirements Gathering & Analysis - Developers collect information from clients or users about what they need.  
Design - The structure of the software is planned, including system architecture, databases, and user interfaces.
Coding-Programmers write the actual code based on the design. 
Testing-The software is tested to find and fix bugs or errors. 
Deployment- The software is released to users, either in a small test version (beta) or a full launch. 
Maintenance- Regular updates and bug fixes keep the software running smoothly. 
 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology-Follows a step-by-step process where each phase is completed before moving to the next. 

-changes are difficult to make once a phase is completed. 

-Done at the end of the development cycle. 

-Minimal involvement until the final product is delivered. 

-Long development time before the final product is released. 

-Extensive documentation is required before development starts. 

Agile Methodology-Iterative and flexible, with continuous development and feedback loops. 

-Highly adaptable; changes can be made at any stage. 

-Continuous testing throughout the development process. 

-Clients give feedback frequently, influencing development. 

-Faster delivery of smaller, working versions of the product. 

-Less focus on documentation; more emphasis on working software. 
Waterfall – Best for Structured and Predictable Projects 

Example: Developing software for medical devices or government systems, where strict regulations and documentation are required. 

Agile – Best for Fast-Changing and User-Centric Projects 

Example: Developing a mobile app or an e-commerce website, where user needs may change frequently. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- Writes the code that builds the software. 

Responsibilities: 

Develops and implements software based on project requirements. 

Debugs and fixes issues in the code. 

Collaborates with other team members to ensure smooth development. 

Keeps the software updated with new features or improvements. 

Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures the software works correctly by testing it. 

Responsibilities: 

Creates and runs test cases to find bugs. 

Automates testing processes when possible. 

Works with developers to fix errors before the software is released. 

Ensures the software meets quality and security standards. 

Project Manager-Oversees the software development process and ensures it stays on track. 

Responsibilities: 

Plans and organizes tasks for the team. 

Manages deadlines and project timelines. 

Communicates with stakeholders and ensures requirements are met. 

Solves challenges that arise during development. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- this is a software application that provides a complete set of tools for writing, testing, and debugging code in one place. Eg; Visual Studio Code 

Importance:  

Code Editing & Debugging: IDEs provide smart code suggestions, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools to help developers write and fix code efficiently. 

Faster Development: Features like auto-completion and code templates speed up the coding process. 

Integrated Tools: IDEs often include built-in compilers, debuggers, and project management tools, reducing the need for external software. 

Version Control System (VCS)- A Version Control System (VCS) helps developers track changes in code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed. Eg;Git 

Importance: 

Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s changes. 

Change Tracking: Keeps a history of all code changes, making it easy to review and debug. 

Backup & Recovery: Protects code from being lost or overwritten accidentally. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debugging- Code doesn’t always work as expected, and finding the problem can be frustrating.

soln:
Break down the problem and test small sections of code. 

Keeping Up with New Technologies- Technology changes fast, and new programming languages, tools, and frameworks keep coming out. 

Soln:
Follow tech blogs and YouTube tutorials. Join developer communities like GitHub, Stack Overflow, or local tech meetups.

Working in a Team- Different team members may have different coding styles or opinions. 

Soln:
Use version control (like Git) to track code changes. Follow coding standards so that everyone writes code in a similar way.

Managing Deadlines and Workload- Balancing multiple tasks and meeting deadlines can be stressful. 

Soln:
Prioritize tasks—focus on the most important ones first. Break big tasks into smaller steps.

Security and Cyber Threats- Hackers can attack software, leading to data loss or security breaches. 

Soln:
Write secure code. Learn basic cybersecurity principles to protect data.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing-Testing individual parts (or “units”) of the code, like a function or module, to check if they work correctly. 

Importance: Helps catch small errors early, making debugging easier. 

Integration testing-Testing how different modules or components work together. 

Importance: Ensures that different parts of the software communicate correctly.  

System testing-Testing the entire software as a whole to verify that all features work correctly together. 

Importance: Helps find any issues that appear when the complete system is used.  

Acceptance testing-Testing done by users or clients to confirm that the software meets their needs before it is officially released. 

Importance: Ensures that the final product is user-friendly and meets business requirements. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining prompts to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

Importance:  

Improves AI Responses - Well-crafted prompts lead to clearer, more accurate, and relevant answers from AI. 

Enhances Efficiency -A good prompt reduces the need for follow-up questions, saving time and effort. 

Customizes AI Output -Users can tailor AI responses to match their needs, whether it’s for research, coding, or creative writing. 

Optimizes AI for Specific Tasks -Helps in AI-powered applications like chatbots, content generation, and automation. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Tell me about technology.

Give a brief explanation of how artificial intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry, with examples. 

Clarity- Focuses on a specific technology, artificial intelligence.

Specific details- Defines the industry, healthcare, and asks for examples.

Concise- directly states what information is needed, a brief explanation.
